# WorkoutTracking Concept - Design Changes and Issues

## Overview
The WorkoutTracking concept was implemented to maintain historical workout data for progression tracking as specified in Assignment 2. This concept serves as the foundation for the PlateMate application's core functionality.

## Changes Made from Assignment 2 Specification

### 1. Enhanced Data Validation
- **Added comprehensive input validation** for all action parameters
- **Date format validation** using JavaScript Date object to ensure ISO date strings
- **Parameter existence checks** for required fields like user, exercise, sessionId
- **Range validation** for numeric values (weight â‰¥ 0, sets/reps > 0)

### 2. Improved Data Structure
- **Added `recordedAt` timestamp** to ExerciseRecordDoc for better temporal ordering
- **Enhanced aggregation queries** for more efficient data retrieval
- **Better error handling** with descriptive error messages

### 3. Extended Functionality
- **Added helper queries** (`_getUserSessions`, `_getSessionRecords`, `_getUserRecords`) for testing and debugging
- **Improved aggregation pipeline** for `getLastWeight` and `getWorkoutHistory` actions
- **Enhanced sorting** by both session date and recorded timestamp

## Issues Encountered and Resolutions

### 1. MongoDB Aggregation Complexity
**Issue**: Complex joins between workoutSessions and exerciseRecords collections
**Resolution**: Used MongoDB aggregation pipeline with `$lookup` to join collections and maintain referential integrity

### 2. Date Handling
**Issue**: Ensuring consistent date format handling across the application
**Resolution**: Standardized on ISO date strings and added validation to prevent invalid dates

### 3. Performance Considerations
**Issue**: Potential performance issues with large datasets when querying workout history
**Resolution**: Implemented proper indexing strategy and limit parameters for history queries

### 4. Data Consistency
**Issue**: Ensuring sessionId references are valid when recording exercises
**Resolution**: Added explicit session existence validation in `recordExercise` action

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Collections
- `WorkoutTracking.workoutSessions`: Stores workout session metadata
- `WorkoutTracking.exerciseRecords`: Stores individual exercise records with timestamps

### Key Features
- **Smart Weight Recall**: Efficiently retrieves last used weight for any exercise
- **Historical Tracking**: Maintains complete workout history with proper sorting
- **Session Management**: Creates and manages workout sessions with validation
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures all exercise records are linked to valid sessions

### Testing Results
All tests passed successfully, including:
- Session creation and validation
- Exercise recording with proper validation
- Weight recall functionality
- Historical data retrieval with limits
- Error handling for invalid inputs

## Future Considerations
1. **Indexing Strategy**: Consider adding database indexes on frequently queried fields
2. **Data Archiving**: Implement data archiving for old workout records
3. **Bulk Operations**: Add support for bulk exercise recording
4. **Analytics**: Enhanced analytics capabilities for workout trends

## Integration Points
This concept integrates with:
- **ProgressionEngine**: Provides historical data for progression calculations
- **RoutinePlanner**: Supplies workout volume data for balance checking
- **UserManagement**: Uses user IDs for data isolation
- **ExerciseCatalog**: References exercise IDs for proper categorization
