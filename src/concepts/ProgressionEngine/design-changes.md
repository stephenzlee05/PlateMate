# ProgressionEngine Concept - Design Changes and Issues

## Overview
The ProgressionEngine concept was implemented to automatically suggest weight progressions based on performance as specified in Assignment 2. This concept implements the "Auto-Progress & Deload Suggestions" feature of the PlateMate application.

## Changes Made from Assignment 2 Specification

### 1. Enhanced Progression Logic
- **Added sophisticated progression algorithms** beyond simple increment/decrement
- **Implemented deload detection** based on significant weight drops (configurable threshold)
- **Added session counting** to track how long a user has been at a specific weight
- **Enhanced suggestion reasoning** with descriptive explanations for each recommendation

### 2. Extended Data Structures
- **Added `WeightSuggestion` interface** with detailed progression information
- **Enhanced `UserProgressionDoc`** with session tracking and progression history
- **Improved `ProgressionRuleDoc`** with configurable parameters for different exercise types

### 3. Additional Helper Actions
- **Added `createProgressionRule` action** for setting up exercise-specific progression rules
- **Enhanced validation** for all progression parameters
- **Improved error handling** with specific error messages for different failure scenarios

## Issues Encountered and Resolutions

### 1. Progression Algorithm Complexity
**Issue**: Determining when to progress, maintain, or deload based on user performance
**Resolution**: Implemented a multi-factor algorithm considering:
- Number of sessions at current weight
- Target session threshold from progression rules
- Significant weight drops (deload detection)
- First-time exercise handling

### 2. Rule Management
**Issue**: Managing progression rules for different exercise types
**Resolution**: Created a flexible rule system allowing:
- Exercise-specific increment amounts
- Configurable deload thresholds
- Customizable target session counts
- Prevention of duplicate rules

### 3. State Management
**Issue**: Tracking user progression state across multiple sessions
**Resolution**: Implemented comprehensive state tracking:
- Current weight for each exercise
- Session count at current weight
- Last progression date
- Automatic state updates based on weight changes

### 4. Deload Logic
**Issue**: Determining appropriate deload amounts and triggers
**Resolution**: Implemented intelligent deload system:
- Percentage-based deload detection (configurable threshold)
- Automatic 10% deload suggestion for significant drops
- Prevention of excessive deloads

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Collections
- `ProgressionEngine.progressionRules`: Stores exercise-specific progression parameters
- `ProgressionEngine.userProgressions`: Tracks individual user progression state

### Key Features
- **Smart Progression**: Automatically suggests weight increases based on performance
- **Deload Protection**: Detects and suggests deloads for safety
- **Session Tracking**: Monitors how long users stay at each weight
- **Rule-Based System**: Configurable progression rules for different exercises

### Progression Algorithm
1. **First Time**: Maintain current weight for baseline
2. **Target Met**: Increase weight after completing target sessions
3. **Deload Detection**: Suggest deload for significant weight drops
4. **Maintain**: Continue at current weight until targets are met

### Testing Results
All tests passed successfully, including:
- Progression rule creation and validation
- Weight suggestion algorithms for different scenarios
- Deload detection and suggestions
- Session counting and state management
- Error handling for invalid inputs

## Future Considerations
1. **Advanced Algorithms**: Implement more sophisticated progression algorithms (e.g., RPE-based, velocity-based)
2. **Machine Learning**: Add ML-based progression suggestions based on user patterns
3. **Exercise-Specific Rules**: More granular rules for different exercise categories
4. **Recovery Tracking**: Integration with recovery metrics for smarter progression

## Integration Points
This concept integrates with:
- **WorkoutTracking**: Consumes historical workout data for progression calculations
- **UserManagement**: Uses user preferences for default increment amounts
- **ExerciseCatalog**: References exercise metadata for rule configuration
- **RoutinePlanner**: May influence workout template selection based on progression needs

## Configuration Examples
```typescript
// Example progression rule for bench press
{
  exercise: "bench-press",
  increment: 5,           // 5 lb increase
  deloadThreshold: 0.15,  // 15% drop triggers deload
  targetSessions: 3       // Progress after 3 successful sessions
}
```
